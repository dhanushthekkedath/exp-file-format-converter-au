### Introduction
&nbsp;

A biological sequence represents a single, continuous molecule of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) or protein. A database refers to a structured collection of information for providing data in a computer-readable form. In the case of a protein database, it explains basic units of the given protein, and properties of proteins such as the name of the protein, length, and specific amino acid sequences. File formats are important for storing managing and exchanging data in science and engineering communities. Basically, a file format is a standard method for encoding biological information that can be stored as a computer file. In a broader sense, it is noted that file formats extend to achieve uniformity in the presentation of biological sequences. Recent advances in software tools for analyzing biological information marked the need for standard file formats for the usage and exchange of biological data for educational and research purposes. Various bioinformatics software has been explored for solving the difficulties associated with encoding complicated genomic knowledge which demands a distinct sequence format. A number of file formats for representing nucleotides (DNA and RNA) and protein were available in public domains.

### Overview of File formats used in Bioinformatics
&nbsp;

A file format, often known as a file extension, represents structured data within a computer file so that software can access and understand data, and properly understand the data that can process it further. In bioinformatics, for example for sequence analysis, there exist different file formats such as alignment file formats and annotation file formats. 

&nbsp;

A few examples of file formats in bioinformatics are listed:

•	File formats were developed with specific purposes for providing compatibility per specific software in computational research. Examples included structure visualizations diagrams and mappings of biological sequences.

•	Easiness in data processing efficiently.

•	Quick readability and accessibility.

### The description on Sequence File Formats in Bioinformatics


As discussed, in the field of bioinformatics, there were many different file formats exist to store DNA and protein sequence information. DNA and RNA use 1 letter codes that represent the bases (A Adenine, T, Thymine, Uracil (U) in RNA instead of T, G-Guanine, and C-Cytosine,) in a sequence format. Proteins are molecules with amino acids as building blocks and each protein differs from the other with respect to its amino acid sequence. Amino acids were represented either by three-letter codes or by one-letter codes.G (Glycine Gly), P (Proline Pro), A (Alanine Ala),  V (Valine Val), L (Leucine Leu), I (Isoleucine Ile), M (Methionine Met), C (Cysteine Cys), F (Phenylalanine Phe), Y (Tyrosine Tyr), W (Tryptophan Trp), H (Histidine His), K (Lysine Lys), R (Arginine Arg), Q (Glutamine Gln), N (Asparagine Asn), E (Glutamic Acid Glu), D (Aspartic Acid Asp), S (Serine Ser), T (Threonine Thr).
Example of a DNA sequence: ATCGGTGACTATCGCATCGTTAACCTCTT
Example of a Protein sequence: GIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN

### Common File Formats in Bioinformatics
The use of different sequence formats by different programs is reported as a major difficulty in the sequence analysis process. Single sequence files or multiple sequence files were used in bioinformatics for sequence analysis.
&nbsp;

Some examples of data formats in Bioinformatics are FASTA format, GenBank file format, EMBL format, Swiss-prot format, DDBJ format, GDE Format, NBRF/PIR Format, Multiple Sequence Alignment Data Format includes (GCG/MSF format, and ALN/Clustal Format) Structural Data Format includes PDB Format, Annotation Data Formats includes GFF, GFF2, GFF3 Format, NGS Data Formats includes SAM/BAM Format, Annotation Data Formats includes FASTQ Format. 

&nbsp;

Other Data formats are 

ABI-binary file format containing sanger sequencing sequence and trace data.

MDL- contains information regarding small molecules (2D structure data)

SFF (Standard flow gram format)- binary file format

An overview of file formats applied in this experiment was discussed in the following sessions.
